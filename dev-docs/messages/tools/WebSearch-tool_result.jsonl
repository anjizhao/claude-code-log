The line just below the \"@@\" line is position 1, the next line is position 2, and so on.(no content)The position in the diff continues to increase through lines of whitespace and additional hunks until the beginning of a new file.\n\n**Multi-line Comment Fields:**\nFor multi-line comments, values for start_line, original_start_line, start_side, line, original_line, and side are shown. For single-line comments, values for line, original_line, and side are shown with a null value for start_line, original_start_line, and start_side.\n\n## Endpoints\n\nThe primary endpoint for pull request review comments is:\n- `GET /repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/PULL_NUMBER/comments` - List comments on a pull request\n- `GET /repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/comments/COMMENT_ID` - Get a specific comment\n- `POST /repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/PULL_NUMBER/comments` - Create a comment\n\nYou can find the complete documentation at the official GitHub REST API documentation for pull request review comments."}]}, "uuid": "1e5e4e35-3c24-475e-b0fc-d637fe46e645", "timestamp": "2025-11-13T13:09:31.016Z", "toolUseResult": {"query": "GitHub API pulls comments endpoint response fields path line position 2025", "results": [{"tool_use_id": "srvtoolu_01PdNZE8CU47uoQo8Euw2JVb", "content": [{"title": "REST API endpoints for pull request reviews - GitHub Docs", "url": "https://docs.github.com/en/rest/pulls/reviews"}, {"title": "REST API endpoints for pull request review comments - GitHub Docs", "url": "https://docs.github.com/en/rest/pulls/comments"}, {"title": "Pull request review comments - GitHub Enterprise Server 3.2 Docs", "url": "https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.2/rest/pulls/comments"}, {"title": "REST API endpoints for pull request reviews - GitHub Enterprise Server 3.12 Docs", "url": "https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.12/rest/pulls/reviews"}, {"title": "REST API endpoints for pull request reviews - GitHub Enterprise Server 3.11 Docs", "url": "https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.11/rest/pulls/reviews"}, {"title": "REST API endpoints for issue comments - GitHub Docs", "url": "https://docs.github.com/en/rest/issues/comments"}, {"title": "REST API endpoints for pull request reviews - GitHub Enterprise Server 3.8 Docs", "url": "https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.8/rest/pulls/reviews"}, {"title": "REST API endpoints for pull requests - GitHub Docs", "url": "https://docs.github.com/en/rest/pulls/pulls"}, {"title": "Working with comments - GitHub Docs", "url": "https://docs.github.com/en/rest/guides/working-with-comments"}, {"title": "REST API endpoints for pull request review comments - GitHub Enterprise Server 3.15 Docs", "url": "https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.15/rest/pulls/comments"}]}, "I found information about the GitHub API pull request comments endpoint response fields including `path`, `line`, and `position`.
